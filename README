# What it is?

This is a very simple workflow, using two simple python script to illustrate, as an example,
how to bring several commandline application into a Docker container, and then how to express them 
into CWL.

## schematic of the workflow

The workflow is composed by two scripts: 

- `transcribe.py` which gets in input a dna.txt file composed by nucleotides and writes a rna.txt
   as output
- `translate.py` which accepts a rna.txt as input and produce a peptide.txt


# Build the image: 

We create an image, called `mmattioni/dna2protein`, and build it using the `Dockerfile`.
Note: `mmattioni` is the username on the Seven Bridges Platform, `dna2protein` is the 
development project we have created there. Change them to yours otherwise won't work.

	docker build -t dna2protein .
	
# We can launch a container, and see if we have everything we need.

	docker run -it dna2protein bash
	
# Launch our scripts from the container:

Transcribe example:

	$ docker run dna2protein transcribe.py -h
	usage: transcribe.py [-h] [-v] [--version] dna
	
	Translates a DNA input test into a RNA
	
	positional arguments:
	  dna			   DNA input file to transcribe
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
	  -v, --verbose
	  --version      show program's version number and exit

Translate example:

	$ docker run dna2protein translate.py -h
	usage: translate.py [-h] [--verbose] [--version] mRNA
	
	Transcribe the provided mRNA into a peptide.
	
	positional arguments:
	  mRNA           mRNA to transcribe
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
	  --verbose, -v  Run in verbose mode (default: False)
	  --version      show program's version number and exit

	
Now our scripts are dockerized and we can use it directly from the image.

# Push our image to the SevenBridges registry

First we need to tag the image. Make sure you have create a dev project called `dna2protein`, otherwise you will
not be able to push the image.

	docker tag dna2protein images.sbgenomics.com/mmattioni/dna2protein

Now we login and push it to the registry. Note: you have to provide you API TOKEN, not the password you use to log 
on the Seven Bridges Platform.

	docker login --username <SBG_USERNAME> --email <SBG_EMAIL> --password <SBG_API_TOKEN> images.sbgenomics.com
	docker push images.sbgenomics.com/mmattioni/dna2protein
	
# CWL associated

The CWL associated for the whole workflow is in the root of the directory and it's called
`dna2protein.cwl.json`

you can run it locally with rabix (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rabix/0.8.0)

	rabix --verbose dna2protein.cwl.json -- --dna dna.txt
